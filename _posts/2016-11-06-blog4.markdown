As i am scrambling to finish this joke of a class<br /> 
i take a look at the clock<br /> 
and realize there is no time left<br /> 
i know that all the answers i have learned are wrong<br /> 
My mind has given up and my focus is gone<br /> 
i know i am gonna fail this sem<br /> 
And that i deserve it<br /> 
i have forgotten all i know but thats not unheard of<br /> 
i have only 4 minutes<br /> 
not gonna finish now all that is to do is sit there drawing a penies<br /> 
My tution's cost me 2 lakh a year<br /> 
But i dont need an education i just need a beer<br />  
These indians are complaining that they are dying but<br /> 
what i am suppose to do i guess i'm fucked up inside<br /> 
this class could not be worse<br /> 
I Am an engineering failure<br /> 
please help me i'm screwed ,you see<br /> 
need to pass this sem to get my degree<br /> 
i can do only worse<br /> 
i am an engineering failure<br /> 
complex algorithm irrational equations<br /> 
statics and dynamics and look at these indians<br />  
everybody studying but there are no solutions<br /> 
Hell the prof. cant even teach us<br /> 
they say i have gotta learn<br /> 
but it feels like i have a curse<br /> 
curse of engineering failure<br /> 
And i know my academic is out of my luck<br /> 
i am screwed you see<br /> 
need to pass this sem to get a degree<br />
