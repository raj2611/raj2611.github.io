As i am scrambling to finish this joke of a class
i take a look at the clock
and realize there is no time left. 
i know that all the answers i have learned are wrong. 
My mind has given up and my focus is gone.
i know i am gonna fail this sem
And that i deserve it.
i have forgotten all i know but thats not unheard of.
i have only 4 minutes, 
not gonna finish now all that is to do is sit there drawing a penies,
My tution's cost me 2 lakh a year
But i dont need an education i just need a beer. 
These indians are complaining that they are dying but 
what i am suppose to do i guess i'm fucked up inside 
this class could not be worse
I Am an engineering failure.
please help me i'm screwed ,you see
need to pass this sem to get my degree
i can do only worse
i am an engineering failure
complex algorithm irrational equations
statics and dynamics and look at these indians 
everybody studying but there are no solutions.
Hell the prof. cant even teach us.
they say i have gotta learn 
but it feels like i have a curse
curse of engineering failure.
And i know my academic is out of my luck
i am screwed you see 
need to pass this sem to get a degree.
