Do you miss them? Do you miss your childhood bruises? 
The scratch on your knee because you fell off your bike or 
when you hurt your ankle while putting a baby bird back in the nest. 
Do you miss how innocent those wounds were? I miss them. 
I miss running in the playground and coming home with sand in my hair  
and a scratch on my face because i wanted to keep the small, stray kitten i found.  
i miss slipping in the rain and falling into a puddle and crying about how my new shoes were ruined  
i laughed a second later when my best friend fell face first as well. 
I miss how every time i got hurt, it was so innocent and pure. 
How every fucking time there was something that'd make it better again.  
I miss mourning the death of my parrot rather than wishing for myself to die. 
i miss playing doctors with my dolls believing everything can be cured 
rather than screaming over someone else pain which cant be cured. 
i miss putting band aids on my cuts so that they'd heal faster whereas now i make them as deep as i can. 
I miss when i could cry about broken crayons and not about a broken heart. 
I miss when an extra chocolate could make my day and 
here i am throwing up the little bit of food i ate because i don't fit the society's view of what "perfect" is. 
i miss how i was and how life changed me. 
Now we all are just a bunch of misfits locked up in our rooms nursing the bruises on our hearts and the scars on our minds.
