Relationship On The Rocks  
It was confusing on the very first day  
he didn't know whether he was coming or going.  
she didn't show her signs he wanted to see.  
Left him at breaking point.  
Loving her for all the wrong reasons.  
Showing a smile for a  moment and then  
changing the topic of choice.  
Love was in the air but how long  
did it last for.  
He didn't know her dark secrets but  
still tried to know her much more.  
Magic is dead but the falseness of time  
comes alive with fakeness  
What is happening with them now ?
