`Desire` is infinite, its fulfilment limited, desire is
unlimited in everyone; the power of fulfilment
varies. Thus some are more successful than others
in life.
Engineering a desire or just a career option to get
good life, good wife or good money. Itâ€™s what we
always wanted to accomplish, everyone, when
they are young knows what their destiny is, I
thought of becoming the richest person. I think at a
certain point in everyone lives, everything is clear
and everything is possible, They are not afraid to
dream and to yearn for everything they would like
to see happen to them in their lives but as time
passes an inner force begins to convince them that
it will impossible for them to realize their destiny.
But the thing is what we desire is most important
rather than thinking of so called society that if you
are an engineer you have a great future but if you
are a photographer or a hair designer you are good
for nothing, it is painful to listen that but ultimately
we have our self respect and we will be happy in
our life.We desire only the pleasurable not the painful. As
desire increases, so increases the power of
pleasure so the power of pain.
But Pain is inevitable, suffering is optional.
So, follow your dream love your desire.
Future is the extension of present..
