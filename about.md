I COULD NOT BECOME ANYTHING:  
NEITHER BAD NOR GOOD, NEITHER 
A SCOUNDREL NOR AN HONEST MAN, 
NEITHER A HERO NOR AN INSECT. 
AND NOW I AM EKING OUT MY DAYS 
IN MY CORNER, TAUNTING MYSELF 
WITH THE BITTER AND ENTIRELY 
USELESS CONSOLATION THAT AN 
INTELLIGENT MAN CANNOT SERIOUSLY 
BECOME ANYTHING; THAT ONLY 
A FOOL CAN BECOME SOMETHING
