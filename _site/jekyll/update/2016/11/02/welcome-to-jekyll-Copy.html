    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Edward Snowden</code> A former CIA employee, who supposedly copied
classified information from NSA of mass surveillance programs,
opertaed by NSA. National Security Agency which is involved in
massive collection of private information like phone records internet
traffic in short NSA thwart internet freedom in around every country
even in India too. There was a bug found in indian embassey and
Rajbhawan too. So the question is, Is he is a whistle blower who
gave us reason to not place trust on our goverment system or just a
traitor. He said The NSA has built an infrastructure that allows it to
intercept almost everything. With this capability, the vast majority
of human communications are automatically ingested without
targeting. If I wanted to see your emails or your wife’s phone, all I
have to do is use intercepts. I can get your emails, passwords,
phone records, credit cards. So basically even if you are not doing
anything wrong you are being watched.
Currently he has being given political asylum by Russian goverment
and staying in Russia. So we have to ask ourselve do we want to
live in a world where there is no privacy and therefore no room for
intellectual exploration and creativity. If NO then why is he a traitor?
“ Privacy matters. Privacy is what allows us to determine who we are
and who we want to be.”</p>
